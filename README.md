# CWI_capture_test

A VS-based demonstrator for the VRTogether-capture code.

# Overview

This demonstrator is a Visual Studio project that shows how to get access to the pointclouds generated by the VRTogether-capture project.
All dependencies of PCL, RealSense and other libraries have been put into two dll files, `multiFrame.dll` and `realsense2.dll` that goes with the example.
The example code in `CaptureTest.cpp` shows how the access function `getPointCloud((long * timestamp, void ** pointcloud)`, that resides in `multiFrame.dll`, can be found and accessed.
The demonstrator gets you a new pointcloud each time you hit the enter key.
Having a RealSense camera connected is not required. If you have none, the code will get you a synthesized pointcloud that is rotating in space.

For those interested, a pointcloud in PCL format can be obtained from the `void** pointcloud` by casting: `captured_pc = *reinterpret_cast<boost::shared_ptr<PointCloud<PointXYZRGB>>*>(pointcloud)
